# Node Basics

On this repository, you will see some examples related to using `NodeJs` to get a basic understanding of this technology. The `commit` history will have the complete journey from the start to the more advanced topics and each `app` that I build will be on its own directory. Finally, this repository is inspired by the [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)
](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/).

## Requirements

- NodeJs
- A terminal(command prompt on windows; command line on linux)
