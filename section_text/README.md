# Node Basics

On this repository, you will see some examples related to using `NodeJs` to get a basic understanding of this technology. The `commit` history will have the complete journey from the start to the more advanced topics and each `app` that I build will be on its own directory. Finally, this repository is inspired by the [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)
](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/).

## Requiretments

- NodeJs
- A terminal(command prompt on windows; command line on linux)
- An editor(I use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Section 1: Installing and exploring Node.js

To begin with, to do these examples you just need a very basic experience with `js` and none for `Node.js` that we will covert from zero. I use `vscode` but you can use any other editor or `IDE` of your choosing the only thing is that we will use some `vscode` features to debug `nodeJs` in the editor but each editor should have its own way to do it. Finally, since I use `macOS` I will refer to the `terminal` but you can do it on another operator system and use the `command prompt` or `command line`; will be the same.

### Installing nodeJs

- On your browser; go to: https://nodejs.org/en/
- Click on the `current` version button
- Use the installer
- When the installer finish; open your terminal
- Type: `node -v`
- You should see the version that you just download from `node` (Use the lasted version for the examples)
- Now you are good to start the example
