# Section 17: Wrapping up

We finish the practice that we intend to do but there are 2 more things that we are going to check:

- Some more suggestions for our apps
- What to do next?

Let's check this out!!!

## New features ideas

Here some ideas propose on the course to add to the apps that we work on.

- `Weather app`: Allow users to use `geolocation` API to get `weather` for their location. Here you will add a button that will get the `user location` and then get its current `weather` so you will have 2 options; type your `location` or `click the button`
- `Task app`: Allow `users` to upload `images` for individual `todos`
- `Chat app`: Let `user` pick from a list of active `rooms` or type in a custom `room` name. Here you will have a `dropdown` will all the `rooms` that have active `users` and if you choose one of those `rooms` you will get to that specific `room` when you `submit`
